Sharetribe contribution instructions

1. Fork the code
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
3. Write your code
4. [Open a Pull Request from your fork to master as early as possible.](https://github.com/blog/1124-how-we-use-pull-requests-to-build-github) Pull Requests are great way to start conversation of a feature. If the Pull Request is work in progress and not yet ready to be reviewed, add a \[WIP\] prefix to the title.
5. Be sure to add automated tests. That's the best way to guarantee that other developers won't accidentally break your feature.
6. When you are ready, rebase (or merge) your branch to include the latest changes from `master`
7. Make sure all the tests pass
8. Remove the \[WIP\] prefix.
